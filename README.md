# url-qr-shortener
Generates a shortened URL link or a QR code with color and shape options

When you execute the main file, it asks a URL and then you choose if you want to generate a shortened url or a QR Code with it.

Shorter URLs are copied direct to clipboard (or to a txt file, if you uncomment the shortener_saver function in 'urlshortener.py' and add it into the main function)

QR Code options are the colors (using tk color picker) and the 'block' format inside the QRCode.
